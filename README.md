### IRL (In Real Life) Application Purpose

The IRL Social Application's purpose is to help users maintain real, tangible relationships in a technological age obsessed with impermanence. The idea is take the idea of social media and flip it on its head. There are plenty of apps aimed at finding new friends - IRL aims to help you keep and foster those friendships for a more fulfilling life. Currently, this project is for practice to gain more skill and understanding of ASP.NET, C# and front-end development.

### What it does
 
 Create, edit, and delete a list of contacts for people you would like to keep in touch with or foster a better connection. There are places for the usual information such as Name, Phone Number, and Address, as well as options for more intimate details such as the person's nickname, birthday, and a section for writing any notes or reminders you would like to save about that person. There is also a section where you may select things that are of interest to you. The purpose of this section is to eventually implement a feature that suggests things to do with a friend based on similar interests.

### To Use

 -Register an account. It will take you to the home page where you can see updates from your friends or post your own (currently in an example layout and is not interactive)

 -Navigate to the Contacts page using the side menu and click "Add Contact" to create a new contact 

 -The links to Edit, View Details, and Delete are to the right of the contact list

 -To add interests to your account, navigate to Your Interests and click "Add". This selection will be added to your chosen interests. 

### Moving Forward

At this point, IRL is still in development. A feature for adding interest information to the user's contacts will be implemented and also a feature offering suggestions of things to do with a person based on mutual interests. Real world suggestions will be offered, utilizing APIs that provide event and social information.
